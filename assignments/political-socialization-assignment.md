title: Assignment 4
subtitle: Political socialization
---

## Assignment goals

Part of the college experience is learning more about ourselves.  As
we discussed in class, each of us has a political ideology, i.e., each
of us has beliefs regarding the nature of people and the role of
government.

The purpose of this assignment is to provide you with an opportunity
to use concepts you have learned in the course to learn more about
your political self.  You will do this by drawing on our discussions
regarding political ideology and political socialization.

## Resources

  - Lecture slides on political ideology and political socialization.
    These are availbe under the course's `Files` section in both
    [MyPage](http://mypage.slcc.edu) and
    [Canvas](http://slcc.instructure.com/)

## Requirements

### Content

  - The first section of your assignment should identify your political
    ideology.  It answers the question, “What is my political
    ideology?”  It should have three parts; these parts may appear in
    any order:

      - What is my ideological label? (conservative, liberal,
        libertarian, socialist, communitarian)

      - What characterizes the ideology to which I subscribe?

      - Which of these characteristics do I see in myself that let me
        assign my label?

  - The second section of your assignment should describe the element, or
    elements, of political socialization that you credit as having the
    most influence on who are are politically.  Was it your parents,
    your church, your school?  Was it a peer group, an opinion leader,
    a political event?


The assignment should be between 1,200 to 1,900 words long.  This is
approximately the same as a four to six-page paper, written in a
12-point font, with inch margins.

## Notes

Very few of us are ideologically *pure*, meaning very few of us
subscribe to every belief of a particular ideology.  We might describe
ourselves as liberal-conservatives if we find ourselves agreeing with
a lot of liberal ideology, but *also* agreeing with some conservative
beliefs.  Don't worry if you can't assign yourself a definite label.

What you *can* do is describe what your beliefs are, and then assign
labels to the beliefs.  For example, if you believe in traditional
gender roles and traditonal family values, you would label these as
conservative beliefs.  If you believe that government is at best a
necessary evil and that it's role in society should be *very* small,
then you would label that as a libertarian belief.
